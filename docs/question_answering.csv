What is a valid offer?,"What was left to be communicated were the details of the bank account into which the price was to be paid. This was a subsidiary question which did not affect the finality of what we construe to be the offer contained in the letter. The appellant also strenuously sought to make a distinction between the language construed to be an offer in Fofie v Zanyo \[1992\] 2 GLR 475 and the language in the present case. This contention was in rebuttal of the view taken by the Court of Appeal that the decision in the Fofie case should lead to the letter of 17 th January 2005 being construed as an offer. Marful-Sau JA had said in the court below, after quoting the text of the offer in the Fofie case, that:  “Indeed comparing the above letter which was held to be a valid offer to Exhibit A in the instant appeal it will be untenable to hold that Exhibit A is not a valid offer.",0.4920665968079061,"{""booksReferredTo"": [], ""caseId"": {""number"": null, ""type"": null}, ""casesReferredTo"": [], ""combinedCounsel"": [""Hayfron-Benjamin for the plaintiff"", ""Sekyi-Hughes for the defendant""], ""combinedParties"": [""IN RE TIMBER AND TRANSPORT KUMASI-KRUSEVAC CO.""], ""counsel"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [""Hayfron-Benjamin""], ""Defendant/Respondent"": [""Sekyi-Hughes""]}, ""court"": {""location"": {""city"": null, ""country"": ""GHANA""}}, ""editorialNote"": null, ""headNotes"": null, ""indices"": [], ""judgement"": {""date"": null, ""year"": null, ""month"": null, ""day"": null}, ""judges"": [""PEVERIL GOLD MINES LTD IN RE  CH  LJCH  LT  WR  TLR  MANS  CA""], ""lawReportsCitations"": [], ""mediaNeutralCitation"": null, ""natureOfProceedings"": null, ""partiesOfSuit"": {""Plaintiff/Appellant"": [], ""Defendant/Respondent"": []}, ""source"": ""ghana-law-report"", ""sourceFile"": ""\\original_source_files\\Cases from 1959 - 1992\\1980\\IN RE TIMBER AND TRANSPORT KUMASI-KRUSEVAC CO..htm"", ""statutesReferredTo"": [], ""title"": {""long"": ""IN RE TIMBER AND TRANSPORT KUMASI-KRUSEVAC CO."", ""short"": ""IN RE TIMBER AND TRANSPORT KUMASI-KRUSEVAC CO.""}}","This contention was in rebuttal of the view taken by the Court of Appeal that the decision in the Fofie case should lead to the letter of 17 th January 2005 being construed as an offer.

Accordingly, the offer has to be definite and final and must not leave significant terms open for further negotiation.

The appellant in the present case in its Statement of Case argues that the distinction between what was construed to be an offer in the Fofie case and the alleged offer in this case lies in the fact that the parties in the Fofie case had had an earlier discussion and the quotation set out above was from a confirmatory letter.
