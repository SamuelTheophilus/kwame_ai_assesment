What is a valid offer?,"The respondents did not agree with what their overlord did and they claimed they destooled him for having done so. This court is not called upon to make a determination as to whether or not he was properly destooled. Until a court of competent jurisdiction declared the acts of Nii Kwakwaranya II null and void it was valid and had a binding effect not only on himself but his successors, assigns, privies and those tracing through him. The respondent tendered the Gold Coast Civil Service List in Exhibit C and C1 which mentioned Ogbojo as a village under La division, but this was countered by the appellant that not all towns and villages mentioned in the list were necessarily for Labadi and cited the village of Maalejon as example.
